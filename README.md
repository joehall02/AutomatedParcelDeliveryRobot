# AutomatedParcelDeliveryRobot
This project is designed for the Zumo32U4 robot platform, focusing on enabling the robot to autonomously navigate through mazes, detect houses, and 'deliver parcels' to these locations. The software does this by utilising the Zumo32U4's line sensors, proximity sensors and motors.
